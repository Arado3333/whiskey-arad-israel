        <h2>How We Started</h2>
        <p>Golani is a family-owned and operated craft distillery, established in September 2014 in Israel’s Golan Heights region.</p>
        <p>The terroir of the Golan Heights region of Israel – a northeastern territory with crystal clear spring water, stunning plateaus, and volcanic soil, the perfect micro-climate, which inspired founder David Zibell to set up shop there.</p>
        <p>Golani Whiskies are crafted from grain to bottle, using a mix of local and imported grains, local spring and well water. No taste or colors are added to the products to assure you taste the Holy Land of Israel!</p>

                    There’s an old industry joke that asks why the Irish triple distill.  The answer goes, “To be sure, to be sure, to be sure!”  There are several things that define Irish whiskey and distinguish its point of difference from Scotch whisky. Despite what many Irish whiskey brand ambassadors would have you believe, triple distillation is not one of them!
